# Campaign App

## Overview
Application that allows user to create, read, update and delete data about campaigns. Each campaigns funds are being updated every hour in order to imitate a real market. Chart.js library is responsible for visualising the progress on the market. The next step in the application development process would be implementing a real-time sign-in/up functionality, so that every seller would be the only person allowed to update the data about his/her campaigns.
